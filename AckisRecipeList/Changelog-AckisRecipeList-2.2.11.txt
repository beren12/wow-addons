James D. Callahan III:
	- Typo fix in embeds.xml
	- I could have sworn I'd removed all of the Quest name localizations two years ago, but here one is!
	- Use the per-profession recipe list wherever possible instead of the monolithic recipe list, removing the requirement to check if the recipe is indeed of the required profession. Minor cleanup along the way.
	- Minor cleanup.
	- Allow more than one debug toast at a time since it's no longer a "Hey, you have debug messages!" toast.
	- The "Faction" obtain filter now displays the name of the opposing faction, and its tooltip now more accurately describes its purpose.
mike:
	- imported phrases for translations
James D. Callahan III:
	- Small logic cleanup and variable renames for clarity.
	- Print the debug message in the debug toast instead of simply stating that there is a new debug message.
	- When inserting a new entry into the list, SET ITS PARENT! This allows collapsing of expanded subheaders by clicking a subentry.
	- Normalized all coordinate displays; the coordinates in the list will now be in the same format as those in the tooltip.
	- Declare faction_labels just before it's needed, and uppercase it since it's a constant.
	- Perform mouseover checks while populating the list instead of iterating over the buttons twice.
	- Minor logic cleanup.

	- Added a new vendor: "Chapman"
