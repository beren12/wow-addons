Ethan Centaurai:
	- Changelog update.
	- Something keeps touching my art files. >:|
	- Confirmed as working, remove debug. Thanks Dizzye and Schnoobuns for the help.
	- Improve last commit.
	- Another attempt at ticket 115. Drycoded as my guild master is a slacker.
	- Remove more uncommented code.
	- Remove Blizzard_Calendar from the optional dependencies. I can't remember why I put it there in the first place. :|a
